Orbital 2020 NU(advert)S

Aim of this project: to create a one-stop, comprehensive web platform where 
1) survey conductors can conveniently source for NUS survey respondents
2) incentives for the NUS community to participate in surveys are created

By resolving the lack of response motivation and lack of survey outreach, survey conductors
can obtain a higher diversity/quantity/quality of responses and survey respondents can unlock
attractive benefits while offering help through sharing of their opinions.
