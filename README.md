Problem Motivation: 
Currently, there is a lack of a common platform for survey conductors to publicise their surveys to the NUS community. As such, many students often take to various social media platforms such as Telegram, Instagram etc. to call for respondents. However, requests for survey respondents through such means are usually ignored as respondents do not see any form of benefits. Furthermore, the constant influx of messages and posts on social media platforms means that such surveys are usually neglected.

Aim: 
The aim of this project is to create a one-stop, comprehensive platform (website) where survey conductors can conveniently source for survey respondents and also to create incentives for the NUS community to participate in surveys. By resolving the lack of response motivation and lack of survey outreach, survey conductors can obtain a higher diversity/quantity/quality of responses and survey respondents can unlock attractive benefits while offering help through sharing their opinions.

User Stories:
As a surveyor who wants to obtain authentic opinions from the NUS student community, I will be able to have a platform to share my survey to a diversity of students at a more efficient, effective and wide-ranging level.
As a surveyor with a target audience in mind, I will be able to filter out a target group of students to take my survey, based on certain attributes (eg Faculty/Gender). The survey will then be promoted accordingly to these groups of students.
As a student respondent who wants to help out fellow students, I will be able to provide immense assistance to the NUS community by providing my opinions.
As a surveyor who would like to ensure that student respondents do not participate in the same survey more than once, I will be able to limit completed survey attempts to once per individual. The system automatically records any completed attempts by any individual for any survey.
As a student respondent who would like to be incentivised after completing a survey, I will be able to earn points after every survey completion, which can then be used to exchange for different rewards/vouchers that are typically related to amenities and dining offers in NUS.
As users of the system, I will be able to flag out inappropriate survey content and responses. The administrators of the system will then send out warnings and subsequently ban users who continue doing so.

Problems Encountered:
Difficulties in implementing and reflecting simultaneous changes across multiple attributes, views and templates. 
Realised potential loopholes in real-life implementation eg who would be providing the rewards and are the rewards suitable/sufficient incentives for users
Setting points earned upon completion of each survey to be 1 across all surveys may be an uneven distribution of points for a ranging level of effort put into survey completion.
