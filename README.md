# Orbital2020

Team Name:
NU(advert)S

Proposed Level of Achievement:
Gemini (Intermediate)

Problem Motivation:
Currently, there is a lack of a common platform for survey conductors to publicise their
surveys to the NUS community. As such, many students often take to various social media
platforms such as Telegram, Instagram etc. to call for respondents.
However, requests for survey respondents through such means are usually ignored as
respondents do not see any form of benefits. Furthermore, the constant influx of messages
and posts on social media platforms means that such surveys are usually neglected.

Aim:
The aim of this project is to create a one-stop, comprehensive platform (mobile
application/website) where survey conductors can conveniently source for survey respondents
and also to create incentives for the NUS community to participate in surveys.
By resolving the lack of response motivation and lack of survey outreach, survey conductors
can obtain a higher diversity/quantity/quality of responses and survey respondents can unlock
attractive benefits while offering help through sharing of their opinions.

Proposed Core Features
1. Index, Login, Logout

2. Administration page 
- For handling database

3. Registration page
- List of compulsory/optional fields to be filled in

4. Survey Creation and Posting
- Types of questions: MCQ / open ended etc
- Selection of target audience features --> survey will only be pushed to and o users with such features




1. Survey Listing system
a. To allow users to create surveys and post them on the mobile application
b. To allow users to respond to surveys posted
2. Filter Function
To facilitate collection of relevant data so that surveys will be sent out to the
appropriate target audience.
a. To allow users to key in and save their key information (Gender, Age, Faculty,
etc.)
b. To allow surveyors to choose their survey target audience based on their key
information
c. To create a push notification system which informs students of surveys that are
targeted at them (Eg. If a survey is targeted at 20 year old students, all 20 year
old NUS students will be notified and prompted to complete the survey via the
push notification system)
Features to be completed by mid of July:
1. Gamification system
To incentivise students to respond to surveys
a. Reward users with points upon completion of each survey
b. Points can be exchanged for rewards (eg vouchers) / boost the popularity of
surveys posted by the user

2. Report function
To prevent misuse of application
a. For respondents: to report inappropriate surveys eg contains discriminatory
questions
b. For surveyors: to report users who display inappropriate responding behaviour
eg inflammatory responses







User Stories
1. As a surveyor who wants to obtain authentic opinions from the NUS student
community, I will be able to have a platform to share my survey to a diversity of
students at a more efficient, effective and wide-ranging level.
2. As a surveyor with a target audience in mind, I will be able to filter out a target group
of students to take my survey, based on certain characteristics (eg Faculty/Gender).
The survey will then be promoted accordingly to these groups of students.
3. As a surveyor who wants my surveys to have a wider reach, I will be able to promote
my survey listings by participating in other surveys to gain points (More points will
allow you to push your survey listings to the top of search results).
4. As a student respondent who wants to help out fellow students, I will be able to
provide immense assistance to the NUS community by providing my opinions.
5. As a surveyor who would like to ensure that student respondents do not participate in
the same survey more than once, I will be able to limit completed survey attempts to
once per individual. The system automatically records any completed attempts by any
individual for any survey.
6. As a student respondent who would like to be incentivised after completing a survey, I
will be able to earn points after every survey completion, which can then be used to

exchange for different rewards/vouchers that are typically related to amenities and
dining offers in NUS.
7. As users of the system, I will be able to flag out inappropriate survey content and
responses. The administrators of the system will then send out warnings and
subsequently ban users who continue doing so.
